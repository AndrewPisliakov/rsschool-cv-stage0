### Briefly About Myself:
***
I am 38 years old. I worked as a salesman with metalworking equipment for 8 years. So, I have good experience with communications (B2B). One time I decided that the most global problem is the optimization process, and software development is really needed for all. I decided to become a JavaScript developer.
<br>

I have learned the programming language JavaScript and other technologies, training exercises and written code for more than one year. The mentor helps me with difficult issues. More than 110+ tasks on CodeWars were done.
