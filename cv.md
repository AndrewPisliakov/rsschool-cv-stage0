***
I am 38 years old. I worked as a salesman with metalworking equipment for 8 years. So, I have good experience with communications (B2B). One time I decided that the most global problem is the optimization process, and software development is really needed for all. I decided to become a JavaScript developer.

>### Code example:
***
Numbers to Objects from `codewars.com`: 

_You will be given an array of numbers. For each number in the array you will need to create an object. The object key will be the number, as a string. The value will be the corresponding character code, as a string. Return an array of the resulting objects. All inputs will be arrays of numbers. All character codes are valid lower case letters. The input array will not be empty._

````JavaScript
function numObj(s) {
    const newArr = [];

    s.forEach(elem => {
        let obj = {};
        if (!obj[elem]) {
            obj[elem] = String.fromCharCode(elem);
        }
        newArr.push(obj);
    });

    return newArr;
}
